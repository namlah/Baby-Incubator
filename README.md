# Baby-Incubator
C code for baby uncubator using atmega16 
Single chip microcontroller, incubator monitoring system that can be integrated with existing incubator monitoring
system. The system consists of temperature sensor which is sensing the data from the incubator. The single chip microcontroller reads and frames the surrounding temperature, humility, respiration
along with the sensor. and if the heat higher the required one the fan turned on if it's lower so the heat is turned on
